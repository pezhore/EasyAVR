Introduction
------------

EasyAVR is a keyboard firmware and keymapper GUI for custom keyboards based 
on USB AVRs.  It is powerful but also really easy to use.  It supports a wide 
variety of custom PCBs, such as Phantom, GH60, and bpiphany's Costar 
replacement controllers.  It also features several advanced functions not 
found on retail keyboards.

The homepage for this package may be found at the following URLs:
